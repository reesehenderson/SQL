# In this final SQL project, I queried multiple tables in a dataset to find statistics about album sales.


#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT CustomerId,FirstName,LastName,Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName
,c.LastName
,i.Invoiceid
,i.invoicedate
,i.BillingCountry
from Invoices i
left join Customers c
on i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
where i.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM Employees
where title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM Invoices;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT distinct e.FirstName,e.LastName,i.InvoiceId
FROM Employees e
JOIN Customers c
ON e.Employeeid = c.SupportRepid
JOIN Invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT i.Total
,c.FirstName as Cust_FirstName
,c.LastName as Cust_LastName
,e.FirstName as Rep_FirstName
,e.LastName as Rep_LastName
,c.Country
FROM Employees e
JOIN Customers c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepid
JOIN Invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT count(*)
FROM Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#9 What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT sum(total)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT i.InvoiceLineId, t.Name
FROM Tracks t
JOIN Invoice_items i
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT i.InvoiceLineId
,t.Name as Track_Name
,ar.Name as Artist_name
FROM Invoice_Items i
LEFT JOIN Tracks t
ON t.TrackId = i.TrackId
INNER JOIN Albums a
ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN Artists ar
ON a.Artistid = ar.Artistid;

#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name as 'Track Name'
,a.Title as 'Album Name'
,g.Name as 'Genre'
,m.Name as 'Media Type'
FROM Albums a
JOIN Tracks t
ON a.Albumid = t.Albumid
JOIN genres g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid
JOIN media_types m
ON t.Mediatypeid = m.Mediatypeid;

#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.FirstName,e.LastName
,ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON e.Employeeid = c.SupportRepId
JOIN Invoices i
ON c.Customerid = i.Customerid
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY e.Firstname;

#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName,ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON e.Employeeid = c.SupportRepId
JOIN Invoices i 
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND InvoiceDate like '%2009%'
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(i.total),2)) DESC 
LIMIT 1;
